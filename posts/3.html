<h1>Have You Ever Wondered Why Flamingos Are Pink?</h1>
<p>Flamingos aren't born pink; they're actually gray. The secret behind their vibrant hue lies in their diet. These fabulous birds dine on a feast of shrimp, algae, and crustaceans rich in pigments called carotenoids. As they munch on this colorful cuisine, their feathers gradually transform into the beautiful shades of pink we associate with flamingos. So, next time you spot one of these elegant creatures, remember they're not just fashionable; they're feasting their way to fabulousness!</p>
